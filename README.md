# Decision Navigator

A free browser-based tool that helps you make better choices by comparing options with weighted criteria, score breakdowns, confidence levels, and a shareable recommendation.

## What It Does

Most people make important decisions using gut feeling, pros/cons lists, or asking around — none of which surfaces what they *actually* value. Decision Navigator forces the process to be explicit:

1. Enter the decision you're making
2. Add the options you're comparing
3. Define the criteria that matter to you — and assign each an importance weight
4. Score each option on each criterion
5. Get a weighted ranking with a confidence level and plain-English recommendation

The most valuable part isn't the final score. It's step 3 — the moment you write down what actually matters to you and how much.

## Features

- **Guided 5-step flow** — Decision → Options → Criteria → Score → Result, one step at a time, no overwhelm
- **Slider-based scoring** — rate each option per criterion with a drag slider, no confusing grid to fill in
- **Can't accidentally skip scoring** — the Result step only unlocks once every option has been rated
- **Weighted scoring engine** — importance weights give the right factors proportionally more influence
- **Confidence level** — calculated from the score gap between rank 1 and rank 2
- **Plain-English recommendation** — not just numbers, a readable summary of why the winner won
- **URL hash sharing** — full state encoded in the URL, zero backend required
- **Local storage autosave** — resumes exactly where you left off, even across browser sessions
- **Copy summary** — clean text output you can paste anywhere
- **Load example** — see the tool fully filled in with a real decision in one click
- **100% client-side** — nothing is sent to a server; share links carry your decision data in the URL itself

## Scoring Formula

```
weightedScore = Σ(score × weight) for each criterion
maxPossible   = Σ(10 × weight) for each criterion
percentage    = Math.round((weightedScore / maxPossible) × 100)
```

Confidence is based on the gap between the top two scores:
- 0–4% gap: Low
- 5–12% gap: Medium
- 13%+: High
